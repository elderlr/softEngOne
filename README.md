There are two JSON files in my Github. One called "RequestPic.JSON" and one called "GivenPic.JSON".
In the "RequestPic.JSON" there will be a column for each name of the user and then under each one will be their various requests. 
In the "GivenPic.JSON" there will be a column for each name, the users request, and the URL for the image returned.
